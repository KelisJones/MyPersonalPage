<font style="font-family:Algerian"><left><h1><b>Running</b></left></font></h1>
<p>Firstly it was about 3 years ago i started running everyday,one of the most important reason as why i got into running was really to stay in shape,as i was becoming</p>
<p>very unfit,i used to struggle on most days but the coming years were like a breeze in the park,secondly the results were tremendous in the years that follow</p>
<p>as i was more fit,active and more in tune with the sports that i do.</p>

<font Face=Algerian"><h1><b>Twelve Pillar Summary Chapters 4-7</h1></b></font>
<p>The book Twelve Pillars offers a road map for achieving success in life.</p>
<p>The fact that "Charlie" is none other than Mr. Davies, the owner of the estate where he works, makes the book particularly interesting,</p>
<p>He assumes a different identity in order to teach Jones a lesson in humility that he probably wouldn't have learned if he had come out as himself right away.</p>




<h1>The Different Lesson that i could apply to me life is:</h1>

<ul>
	<li>To Be Pure.....meaning <q><i>i should make sure that the outside of myself is a good reflection of the inside of me.</q></li></i><br>
	<li>Surround myself with the Thriiving people.......meaning<q><i>i shouldn't join an easy crowd, as i wonâ€™t grow. I shoulg go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.</li></q></i><br>
	<li>To be a long life learner.....meaning <q><i>formal education will make me a living, self-education will make me a fortune.</li></i></q><br>
	<li>Patience is Key.....meaning <q><i>i should be patience in every thing that i do as a patient person is a more grounded individual</li></q></i><br>
